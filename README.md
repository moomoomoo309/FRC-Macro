# FRC-Macro

This utility, when implemented into a robot, will allow for the recording of "macros" during teleop on practice fields, and the playback of those macros in autonomous.

To implement this class into your existing code:

-Look at the exampleMacroRobot class, and add the code from it into your robot's class.

-Replace any instance of a Joystick with a simulatedJoystick.

-Done!
